## Tasos : Excercise:

Create a class based React Component that has a state that contains an array with 4 color string values ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'). For each element of this array the component should render a child component (functional) that displays the index of the element in the array and has its background color as the value of the same array element. Post the link of the solution below :)
